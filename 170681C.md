# Distributed Ledger

A Ledger contains all the transactions performed on assets of the system. Since every peer who is part of the system maintains it, it is a distributed ledger. This ledger is immutable. All the nodes in the network should agree on what blocks should be added to the ledger. Hyperledger Fabric uses a Raft base consensus algorithm.

# Smart Contract

Smart Contracts are small programs which define what sort of transactions we can perform on assets. In Hyperledger Fabric these are known as chain code.
